# Docs

This folder contains the slides for the presentation, and links to some useful resources.

## Building the docs

The docs are built from the Markdown source file using Marp, which can be installed [here](https://marp.app/).

To build, run:

```sh
marp Slides.md
```

This will generate a `Slides.html` file, which can then be opened in any browser.

A prebuilt HTML file is also provided, which can be opened [here](Slides.html).
